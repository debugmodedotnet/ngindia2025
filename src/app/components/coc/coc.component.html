        We want to provide a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
        regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age,
        religion or lack thereof. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
        participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
        for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants
        violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
        without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

        <hr class="hr-red-gradient mt-2" />
        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
          comply immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers
          retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming
          environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender
          or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
        </p>

        <p>
          Event organisers may take action to address anything designed to, or
          with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the
          environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to
          follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social
          activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event
          activities too!

        <h3 class="mb-0 font-family-poppins nmc-primary">INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE</h3>
        <hr class="hr-red-gradient mt-2" />
        <p>
          In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment we
          strongly believe it’s important to pay attention to harmful language
          patterns.
        </p>

        <h5 class="font-family-poppins nmc-dark-grey">Ableism</h5>
        <p>
          Words like “crazy”, “dumb”, “insane” or “lame” are examples of ableist
          language, devaluating people who have physical or mental disabilities.
          Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend,
          but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words
          can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we
          want to communicate.
        </p>

        <h5 class="font-family-poppins nmc-dark-grey">Sexism</h5>
        <p>
          Using gendered terms like “dude” or “guys” to address a mixed-gendered
          group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of
          underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered
          pronouns as well as gendered terms.
